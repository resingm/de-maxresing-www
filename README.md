In August 2025, I worked on a major refactor of my personal home page. I moved
away from a static site generator, and instead implemented a dynamically
generated page, leveraging FastAPI, Jinja2 templates and markdown content.

Additionally, I added a handful of API endpoints. I expect, that over the time
I will add more and more features to my website, since the new architecture and
implementation simply opens up for so many more opportunities.

Feel free to roam around [my website](https://www.maxresing.de) and this
repository. If you have questions about it, drop me a question as indicated on
my contact page:
