            <p>
            Since I am a student, I appreciate job offers. Nevertheless, my study is my most important priority.
            Free-lancing requests will only be answered if they fit in at least <b>one</b> of these categories:
            <ul>
                <li>Open source contributions</li>
                <li>Charity for a project</li>
                <li>Fair payment</li>
