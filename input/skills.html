          This page should briefly introduce a few of my skills and should provide an overview of the technical knowledge that I consider myself to have.
          Please keep in mind, that this is not a pedantic and overly detailed listing but rather a broad overview to give you an idea of my skill set.
          </p><p>
          I decided to exclude technology which I take for granted in the IT sector. This includes knowledge of HTML, CSS, SQL, programming paradigms as OOP, FP, system administration &amp; networking, common protocols, user &amp; permission management, ... <br>
          In addition, the list excludes common frameworks of given programming languages. My experience with frameworks always depends on the experience I have with a given language and the complexity of the projects I worked on.
          In case you want to know more about a particular skill, please do not hesitate to contact me.
