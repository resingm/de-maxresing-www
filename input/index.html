            My name is <b>Max Resing</b>.
            I am a full-time <b>computer science student</b>, part-time <b>full-stack developer</b>, enthusiast of <b>open source</b> software and a passionate <b>system administrator</b> of my humble home lab - a stack of Raspberry Pis dedicated to personal services and projects.
            </p>
            <p>During my early childhood I developed my interest in computers.
            With the age of 8 years I got my first own computer.
            It got an Intel Pentium processer, 256MB memory, 700MB disk space and was powered by a glorious Windows 95 OS.

            My unsatisfiably curiousity urged me to dig deeper and deeper into the world of computer science.
            I developed a mentality that computers can make anything possible.
            The limits are defined by our imagination and our will of investment.

            <p>
            These days, I am focussed on Linux environments and on teaching myself the Rust programming language.
            Occasionally, I try to challenge myself with cyber security challenges.
            As every enthusiastic computer science engineer, I love spending time on side projects, open source software and new technology.
            In my spare time, I also love to read and to travel.
