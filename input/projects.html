                <h3>yacf - Yet Another Configuration Framework</h3>
                <p>
                My growing involvement in Python based services revealed that I tend to parse configuration files similarly over different projects.
                Thus, I decided to package and publish my own configuration parsing framework.
                </p><p>
                The feature scope is quite limited, since it was intended to be a slim framework.
                Still, it gives the developer the power to merge and prioritize configurations from different sources, e.g. default configuration, custom configuration file, environment variables and command line arguments.
                The framework reflects my preferred way of handling configurations.

                Initially hosted on <a href="https://github.com/ourway/webfsd">webfsd</a> did I provide a service to host static file content.
                Since my servers are running 24/7, I figured that it would not hurt to host selected content for other people as well.

                When I started converting my services from bare-metal to containers, I switched to an nginx instance.

            <p>
            Running some servers at home allows me to be in full control of data that I make available.
            Thus, I dedicated one domain solely for the purpose of hosting my documentation.
            </p><p>
            The repository is extended by projects whenever I think a project is worth the effort.
            Feel free to contact me, if you want to host your documentation there.

                One component of my home lab is a powerful server. To save power, it runs on demand and can be activated with it's WoL feature.
                The project is a simple wake-on-lan client to broadcast magic packets to the network.
