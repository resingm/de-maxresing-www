            My name is Max Resing, as you might have guessed. Since 2018, I have been studying <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/bachelor/programmes/technical-computer-science/">Computer Science &amp; Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/">University of Twente</a> in Enschede, the Netherlands. Primarily, I am a Linux enthusiast and try to steer my career into cyber security.
            I believe in the potential of web services and the cloud. In my free time, I try to experiment with web services, to broaden my knowledge.
            Casually, I try to improve my knowledge in C to be able to contribute to some open-source projects.
            </p><p>
            In 2014, I started my official computer-science career as an apprentice at <a href="https://www.gws.ms//">GWS mbH</a>. After finishing my apprenticeship, I continued working there which results in a total of 4 years of work experience. The apprenticeship taught me to manage and to implement enterprise software.
            In summer 2015, I challenged myself during my full-time apprenticeship with an extra qualification of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, called <a href="https://www.ihk-nordwestfalen.de/bildung/Fortbildungspruefungen/europaassistent/3610858">&quot;European Assistant&quot;</a>.
            This additional qualification realigned my personal orientation completely. An internship at <a href="https://www.alphacc.ie/">AlphaCC</a> in Bray, Ireland, gave me first insights on work experience abroad.
            Since then, I decided to move to Dublin for 6 months to gain proficient language skills. In the mean-time, I was working remotely. I finished my stay with an IELTS certificate.
            </p><p>
            So far, I have gained a great skill set which helps me to solve my daily challenges. I am proficient in Java, C# and Python. During my apprenticeship, I also gained decent C/AL know-how. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are familiar, but I would not consider myself to have it mastered yet. As already mentioned, I am a beginner in C and Rust. 
            Besides those skills, I try to teach myself new things whenever I can.
