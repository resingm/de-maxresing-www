Here you can see a very brief selection of the projects I have worked on.
Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. If you look for all my
contributions, I refer to my [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/resingm)
and [GitHub](https://github.com/resingm) repositories.

# yacf - Yet Another Configuration Framework

With advancing Python projects, I realized I tend to parse configuration files
similarly in all projects I have worked on. Thus, I decided to abstract the
logic and wrap it into a package.

*yacf* is a very lightweight and slim configuration framework with very limited
features. It aims to not end up as a bloated and convoluted framework.
Configuration has to be kept simple and maintainable.

# static.maxresing.de

This service was initially hosted on [webfsd](https://github.com/ourway/webfsd).
It aims to serve static content. My servers are running 24/7 anyway, so I
figured I could also allow other people to host their files on this service.

This is mostly aimed to host resources for friends. However, I am open to invite
anyone if they want to share their resources. I moved away from webfsd at some
point. These days, the service is running on [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com).

# Documentation: resing.dev

Running some servers at home allows me to host my own services. At some point
I decided to host a dedicated service for the documentation of my projects.

[resing.dev](https://resing.dev) hosts statically generated pages. The docs of
my own projects were generated with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The theme
is the self-written [mkdocs-boring-theme (offline)](https://resing.dev/mkdocs-boring-theme).

Feel free to contact me, if you want to host your own documentation here as well.
In the future, I might extend this service with some deployment pipelines.

# Bakkiecounter.com

This web app is aimed to help tracking your coffee consumption. It is
intentionally kept simple. The project is a result of a few days of rapid
development. After finishing the core application, we decided to not spend much
time on it anymore, except of using it.

Feel free to use it as well. It is free of charge.

## Why?

A friend of mine and me decided to track our coffee consumption. We discovered
that there is no open-source app on the market. The app we were using was an
outdated Android application released for Android 2.7. Even if we would not
bother about the UX, the closed-source and the outdated implementation can be
a potential vulnerability. Hence, we started working on our own web application.
