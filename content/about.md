# About

The domain [maxresing.de](https://www.maxresing.de) is my personal home page.
It helps to present myself and the work I was involved. It also gives an idea
about my technical knowledge. Furthermore, one can find essential documents,
i.e. my [Curriculum Vitae](https://static.maxresing.de/doc/CV.pdf) and links to
my projects.


## About the code

The site was generated with a simple python script, which I wrote myself. The
code of the website, as well as the generation script `makesite.py` can be found
on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/resingm/de-maxresing-www).

The site templates mimic the [mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html).
The content is preprocessed markdown. The preprocessor ensures additional
features to render the pages as I want them to be rendered.


## About your privacy

The service does not log any PII (personally identifiable information). The
website is hosted on a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) instance, which is
configured to not store any IP addresses or other personal information.
