**Facing a new challenge as a DevOps engineer**

*2021-09-30* After more than a year working as a full-stack developer at
<a href="https://www.extendas.com/">Extendas</a> I decided to face a new
challenge. At Extendas, I was working on a cloud solution to centrally monitor
peripherals and hardware of a customer's site. This innovative approach aims to
speed up the service processes of gas stations and washing streets. After
deploying the first version as a pilot I decided to move on and search for a new
challenge.
During the summer break, I was asked to work on a project to evaluate the health
of DNSSEC compliant records within two TLDs of Europe. The project team is part
of DACS at the University of Twente. After the summer break, I was asked to
continue my work on this project. My role is that of a DevOps engineer.

**Best Paper Award - Passed with a 9.5**

*2021-07-02* Recently, I finished my Bachelor Thesis and presented it on the 
[35th Twente Student Conference on IT](https://sites.google.com/utwente.nl/tscit35/homepage).
I am proud to announce that my paper was rewarded with the Best Paper Award and
thus, it was presented to the greater audience during the plenary session.
The paper analysed internet scanning activity to provide evidence that certain
scanners will not show up in honeypot logs if the entire sensor infrastructure is
purely operated in the cloud. The work was graded with a 9.5.
You can find the paper [here](http://purl.utwente.nl/essays/86889).

**Stopped service for documentation**

*2021-05-01* Recently, the domain name of resing.dev expired, and I do not intend
to extend it. Thus, the service for my documentation is put offline. Instead, I will
likely launch the service under a subdomain of [maxresing.de](https://www.maxresing.de).
Expect an update anytime soon.
