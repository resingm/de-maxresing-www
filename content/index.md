My name is Max Resing. I am a full-time computer-science student, a full-stack
developer in part-time, an enthusiast of open-source software and a passionate
system administrator of my humble home lab. My home lab is a stack of four
Raspberry Pis which run my personal projects and services.

**Launched service to host documentation**

*2020-12-03* Since a while I planned to host a service which it's sole purpose
is to serve documentation. Apparently, it took me longer than expected, because
I started over and over again. I simply could not commit myself to a fixed set
of features.

After all, I decided to skip any interactive features and move on with the 
next project. You can find the service on [resing.dev](https://www.resing.dev)

**Bye-bye GitLab, G'day Codeberg**

*2020-11-26* Recently, I decided to leave [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and 
started to move to the more independent alternative [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org).
Similar to GitHub and GitLab is also Codeberg a code collaboration platform.
It is based on [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/).

New repositories will always be created on Codeberg. Existing repositories
will be transferred in the long run.
