My name is Max Resing. I am a full-time computer-science student, a full-stack
developer in part-time, an enthusiast of open-source software and a passionate
system administrator of my humble home lab. My home lab is a stack of four
Raspberry Pis which run my personal projects and services.

**Bachelor Thesis received Best Paper Award**

*2021-07-02* Recently, I finished my Bachelor Thesis and presented it on the 
[35th Twente Student Conference on IT](https://sites.google.com/utwente.nl/tscit35/homepage).
I am proud to announce that my paper was rewarded with the Best Paper Award and
thus, it was presented to the greater audience during the plenary session.
The paper analysed internet scanning activity to provide evidence that certain
scanners will not show up in honeypot logs if the entire sensor infrastructure is
purely operated in the cloud. A link to the paper will be provided soon (approx. July 25).

**Stopped service for documentation**

*2021-05-01* Recently, the domain name of resing.dev expired, and I do not intend
to extend it. Thus, the service for my documentation is put offline. Instead, I will
likely launch the service under a subdomain of [maxresing.de](https://www.maxresing.de).
Expect an update anytime soon.

**Bye-bye GitLab, G'day Codeberg**

*2020-11-26* Recently, I decided to leave [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and 
started to move to the more independent alternative [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org).
Similar to GitHub and GitLab is also Codeberg a code collaboration platform.
It is based on [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/).

New repositories will always be created on Codeberg. Existing repositories
will be transferred in the long run.
