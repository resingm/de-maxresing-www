My name is Max Resing. I am a passionate computer science student who
has a huge interest in networking & Internet data as well as data
processing (platforms). Besides studying, I am a former full-stack
developer employed by different medium-sized companies. Currently, I am
employed at the University of Twente, supporting projects of OpenINTEL.
Our current project focusses on continuously monitoring the DNSSEC
deployment in the TLDs of Switzerland and Liechtenstein.


Next to my study and professional involvement, I like extending my own
home lab in which I develop and operate my own project ideas.
