This page should briefly introduce a few off my skills and my technical
knowledge. Please keep in mind that I am a passionate learner who teaches
himself new things every single day.

I decided to exclude technology, that I take for granted. This includes but is 
not limited to HTML, CSS, SQL, programming paradigms as OOP, FP, basics of
system administration & networking, common protocols, operating systems, user &
permission management,...
