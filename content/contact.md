## Project feedback

I always appreciate feedback to my work. If you have critical input, I will be
happy to read it.


## Job requests/Free-lancing

Despice the fact that I am a student, I am always looking for opportunities to
prove myself. If you think you have an interesting offer for me, please let me
know. I am happy to discuss it with you.

If it is regarding some open-source contribution or some charity event, I would
love to help.
