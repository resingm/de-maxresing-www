subtitle: Passed my Bachelor Thesis with a 9.5
---

Recently, I finished my Bachelor Thesis and presented it on the [35th Twente Student Conference on IT](https://sites.google.com/utwente.nl/tscit35/homepage). I am proud to announce that my paper was rewarded with the Best Paper Award and thus, it was presented to the greater audience during the plenary session. The paper analysed internet scanning activity to provide evidence that certain scanners will not show up in honeypot logs if the entire sensor infrastructure is purely operated in the cloud. The work was graded with a 9.5. You can find the paper [here](http://purl.utwente.nl/essays/86889).
