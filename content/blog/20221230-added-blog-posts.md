For a long time, I struggled with adding blogging features to my website. I liked the simplicity, of my deployment pipeline, so it should not be a complete overhaul. Instead I worked on my own (what I like to call a) site generator. The project is dubbed lopsgen - an acronym of "Lua-based oppinionated site generator".

The project taught me some Lua - a language that was on my wish list for quite a while. Further, I appreciate having blog-posts back on my website. It will be used for announcements and projects I am working on.

The project is not yet complete, but functional enough to generate basic blogging features to my homepage. I do not plan to build a full-blown static site generator. Some basic navigation features will be enough to serve my needs.
