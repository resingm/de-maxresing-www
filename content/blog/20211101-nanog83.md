        The talk is recorded and online

        After my bachelor's thesis was published, I was contacted and asked whether I could consider submitting this topic to NANOG, the North American Network Operators' Group. With a bit of guidance through my shepherd, my talk was accepted, and I was invited to talk at the next NANOG conference, [NANOG83](https://www.nanog.org/events/nanog-83/).

It was a great experience to talk at NANOG, to present my work and to get some responses from people who work and research for much longer in this domain. Furthermore, I enjoyed the other fascinating talks. Check out the recording of my talk: [Should Network Operators Hop on the Data Plane? - NANOG83](https://www.nanog.org/news-stories/nanog-tv/nanog-83-webcast/should-network-operators-hop-on-the-data-plane)
