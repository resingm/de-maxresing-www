        After more than a year working as a full-stack developer at [Extendas](https://www.extendas.com/) I decided to face a new challenge. At Extendas, I was working on a cloud solution to centrally monitor peripherals and hardware of a customer's site. This innovative approach aims to speed up the service processes of gas stations and washing streets. After deploying the first version as a pilot I decided to move on and search for a new challenge. During the summer break, I was asked to work on a project to evaluate the health of DNSSEC compliant records within two TLDs of Europe. The project team is part of DACS at the University of Twente. After the summer break, I was asked to continue my work on this project. My role is that of a DevOps engineer.
